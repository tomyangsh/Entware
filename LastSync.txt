    mac80211: set basic-rate for mesh interfaces
    
    Basic rates were not set for mesh-interfaces, resulting in the undesired
    behavior where 11s frames might be sent with a rate which was not
    configured.
    
    Depending on the driver, the basic rate might also be used to determine
    the beacon rate configured to the chip. One such example are MediaTek
    MT7915 platforms.
